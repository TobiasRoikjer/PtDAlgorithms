\title{Computes the covariance of the discrete phase-type distribution}
\usage{
dph_covariance(phase_type_graph, rewards1, rewards2)
}
\arguments{
\item{phase_type_graph}{A reference to the graph created by \code{\link[=create_graph]{create_graph()}}}

\item{rewards1}{First vector of rewards, which should be applied to the discrete phase-type distribution. Must have length equal to \code{\link[=vertices_length]{vertices_length()}}}

\item{rewards2}{Second vector of rewards, which should be applied to the discrete  phase-type distribution. Must have length equal to \code{\link[=vertices_length]{vertices_length()}}}
}
\value{
The covariance of the discrete distribution given the two rewards
}
\description{
This function invokes \code{\link[=dph_expected_waiting_times]{dph_expected_waiting_times()}}
twice to find the first and second moment for each of the two rewards
